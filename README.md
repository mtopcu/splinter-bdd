### Splinter BDD

As you know Splinter doesn't have BDD feature as a test automation tool. By combining with Behave that is possible! 
On Web UI side, it uses the Splinter Library as web driving and Behave Library as BDD tool. 
On Api side, it uses the Requests Library to send requests, Simplejson for Json parsing and 
Behave Library as BDD tool. As result, it is so easy to use for both Api and Web automated tests. :)

### Install

Run "pip install -r requirements.txt". Then go to under api or web path and run "behave". Here we go!
